          <h4>Doornox helps you connect to job posters directly </h4> 
          <p> Tired of trying to get a recruiter's attention by posting your resume on a job board? You don't need to apply to black holes to get your foot in the door anymore. <a target="_blank" href ="http://www.jobvite.com/resources/jobvite-index/"> 40% </a> of all hires come through employee referrals. Doornox helps you find employees who can refer you. </p> <p> Doornox is unique in that job posters post jobs for <strong> free </strong> to earn company referral bonuses and to help their companies hire. You, the job seeker, search their job posts and message them privately for referrals. This means more opportunities are posted for you, and you can directly contact employees on the inside. Doornox is simply a network to find and give referrals. </p>
          <br>
          <h4> Why the name Doornox? </h4>
          <p> "When one door closes, another opens," and in the metaphorical sense, that's what our name means. Nox's Latin roots mean "night," or "to close," but spoken out loud, Nox is to knock and therefore to open doors. Doornox is symbolic for both closing and opening the right doors to help you find fulfilling work. </p>

          <!--    Foot in the Door, Opportunity at your Door, Knock on some doors, Nox means to close -->
          <!--<h4> Our mission is to make job referrals easier and quicker </h4>
          <p> To get inside an organization, you often have to know someone inside an organization. And for hiring managers, great talent might be right around the corner of their networks, but that talent may be unaware of company openings. We're building Doornox to help you- the job seeker, referrer, and hiring manager- to connect with the right individuals to make referrals a seamless activity. We want to help companies leverage their employees' connections by empowering everyday employees to become mini-recruiters. In today's day and age, a personal connection on the inside is what makes a candidate skip the resume pile and helps a hiring manager find a quality hire. That's why we feel referrals are the best way to go. </p> -->
